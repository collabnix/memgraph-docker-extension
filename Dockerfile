    com.docker.extension.detailed-description="<p><b>Memgraph</b> is an <b>open-source graph database</b> built for streaming and compatible with Neo4j.</p><p>Memgraph directly connects to your streaming infrastructure, so you and your team don’t spend countless hours building and maintaining complex data pipelines. You can ingest data from sources like <b>Kafka</b>, SQL, or plain CSV files. Memgraph provides a standard interface to query your data with <b>Cypher</b>, a widely-used and declarative query language that is easy to write, understand and optimize for performance. This is achieved by using the <b>property graph data model</b>, which stores data in terms of objects, their attributes, and the relationships that connect them. This is a natural and effective way to model many real-world problems without relying on complex SQL schemas.</p><p>Memgraph is implemented in C/C++ and leverages an <b>in-memory</b> first architecture to ensure that you’re getting the best possible performance consistently and without surprises. It’s also ACID-compliant and highly available.</p><p>With Memgraph Docker Extension, you can now set up the Memgraph Platform in no seconds.</p>" \
